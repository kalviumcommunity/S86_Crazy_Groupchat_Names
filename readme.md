# Project Title: Crazy Group Chat Names

## Project Overview:
This project is a fun tool that helps users come up with funny, cool, or crazy names for their group chats. Users can enter a few words, and the app will suggest group names based on those words. They can also randomly generate names or choose from categories like "funny," "cool" and "crazy."

## Key Features:
Keyword-based name generation: Type in some keywords and get group chat names related to them.
Random name generator: Get a random group chat name with one click.
Categories: Choose from different categories like "funny," "cool," or "crazy" to get specific types of names.
Save & share: Save your favorite names and share them with others.
Favorites list: Keep a list of your favorite names for easy access later.

## Tech Stack:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or frameworks like React/Vue.js), using Tailwind CSS for styling.
Backend: Node.js with Express for handling requests and logic.
Deployment: Heroku or Vercel for hosting the app.


## Why This Project:
This project is fun, funny, cool, and crazy, and it also helps improve my coding skills. It lets me work on both frontend and backend development, including using randomization techniques and APIs. Plus, it’s a simple solution to a common problem—picking a fun, cool, or crazy name for a group chat—making it an enjoyable project to work on.
